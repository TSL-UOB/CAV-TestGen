# CAV-TestGen

This is a repo for the Test Generation Methodology paper. This is an opportunity to present the different methods we have devised in theory or practice for test genearation specifically for CAV. 

Areas could be around: 

-Accidentology 

-Crowd sourcing (game, gui builder) 

-AI (MAS, agency, q-learning, game theory) 

-Environmental survey & Hazard analysis 

A good opportunity to demonstrate the strengths of each method, where they compliment and where they are unique. 

We should aim for a high profile journal for this work.
